This project is based on Dunkin Donuts contactless/online orders. The goal is to compare orders to determine the most popular items and to see when 
the busiest time(s) of the day is. The intended audience is my boss and the general public. I obtained the data by printing out about 100 receipts for one 
day while working. I have to compile the data into a csv. Intense statistical analysis is not needed, the project will just compare categorical variables and times.
In order to make this interactive, I have to sharpen my hover-over skills for the doughnut graphs pictured below. I plan to use a time series graph for busiest 
times of the day, douhgnut graph for popular donuts, and a bar graph for all other items ordered.
